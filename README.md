## Analysis scripts Code-Review-Editor log data

This is a tiny project of some sweet python scripts to analyse log data from my study on a code review editor.
It reads the raw json data and outputs severall csv files with more useful data for further analysis.

For data privacy reasons the data itself is not included.

You can start by running:
- `run_analysis.sh`
- `run_analysis_python3.sh` (use this for `python3` specifically)

or run scripts individually.

No external packages are needed.
